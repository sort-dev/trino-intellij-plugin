# Agent Guide

## Commit identity (Buzz agents)

When you (a Buzz agent) commit on someone's behalf, attribute the commit to the
**human who issued the request**, not to the machine's global git identity.

1. The requester is the signed author pubkey of the triggering Buzz event.
2. Look that pubkey up in [`.buzz/authors.toml`](.buzz/authors.toml) to get the
   git `name` / `email`.
3. Commit as that identity, crediting the model as a co-author:

   ```bash
   GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="<name>" GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="<email>" \
   git commit -m "<subject>

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

4. **Pubkey not in `.buzz/authors.toml`?** Stop and ask — never silently fall
   back to the machine's global identity. Add the person (reviewed) first.

This matters for a **shared** Buzz agent that acts for several people. A person's
own standalone agent that only ever commits as its owner can ignore it — that
agent's global git identity is already correct.
